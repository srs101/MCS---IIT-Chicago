# Hello
This is my repositoary for all of my courses I took at Illinois Institute of Technology for my Masters of Computer Science.
<br>I have tried to docuemnet my projects, assignments and few my favorite memories as correctly as possible. I'm just happy that I got this opportunity to exprience such a wonderful place, Chicago 
and meet so many amazing people during this time.
I wish the very best to all and appologize for my HUGEEEE fu/ks ups as I was still learning and just 23 when I started my Masters. I was never prepared for this beautiful and chaotic jounrney. <br><br> 
Everything and mean everything such as giving my Visa Interview just 4 days before my flight to the States, packing at the last minute, not having a plan, plave to stay, never communicted with anyone, hvaing no one to accompany me with flight or anything. Picking up some other passengers luggage and forgetting mine in the plane
, trying to find the rightful owner of it and locating my bag containing my passorts, visa, boarding pass and all other important docuements on a cold chilly morning around 2:00 AM at India's not so busiest airport: Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi, all alone stranded with some
random pasengers bag. <br><br>I don't know how
but somehow I ended up at O'hare airport on August 16 2022.
