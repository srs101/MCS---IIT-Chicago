# Hello
This is my repository for all the courses I took at Illinois Institute of Technology during my Master’s in Computer Science.<br>
I have tried to document my projects, assignments, and a few of my favorite memories as accurately as possible. I'm just happy that I had the opportunity to experience such a wonderful place—Chicago—and meet so many amazing people during this time.<br>
I wish the very best to everyone and apologize for my <h3><b>HUGE</b></h3> mess-ups as I was still learning and only 23 when I started my Master’s. I was never prepared for this beautiful and chaotic journey.
<br><br>
Everything—and I mean everything—was done last minute, like giving my Visa interview just 4 days before my flight to the States, packing at the last moment, having no plan, no place to stay, not communicating with anyone, and having no one to accompany me on the flight. I even picked up someone else’s luggage and forgot mine on the plane! <br>
I was scrambling to find the rightful owner and locate my own bag containing my passport, visa, boarding pass, and all other important documents on a cold, chilly morning around 2:00 AM at India's not-so-busy Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi—all alone and stranded with a random passenger’s bag.
<br><br>
I don’t know how, but somehow I ended up at O'Hare Airport on August 16, 2022.
