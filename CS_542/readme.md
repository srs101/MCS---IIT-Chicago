# Computer Networks I: Fundamentals
This was first coure under Prof. Chlebus Edward. And this was again, a very fun and interesting course.. I genuienly enjoyed Prof. Edward's teaching style and approach. This was my first pen-papaer course,
I enjoyed joting down notes, the ocasional doodling and some rare matches of tic-tac-toe with my classmates. Prof. Edward has a strong asscent which I admire, he's from Poland and has a calm 
way of speaking. He used to refer as "My friends" in a deep and soft voice. I got the opportunity to meet Sukhi and Raghu bro. They were my teammates for assignmnets as well as studying, making notes and always giving 
mostly correct answers to the professor's questions.<br>
We all love chai (Tea) and were are possible addicts for it. Even thought this course is said to be the most challenging, this seemed simple to me.
This course had approximately 400 students enrolled. So we all three tried our best to get the first seats just in front of the professor, giving god-knows what answers to the professor's questions.
This was one of most memorable courses I toook.
