# Natural Language Processing
I took this course under Prof. Kai Shu during Fall '22. This was one of the most fun and innovative courses I took. <br>
Having no experience with Natural Language Processing or anything related to it, this course still felt like a breeze. I was awestruck by Prof. Shu's teaching methods and calm demeanor.<br>
His ability to make the most complex concepts easy to understand was such that even beginners could grasp NLP and gain the confidence to work with LLMs.<br>
His interactions with us are one of the things I'll never forget. He pushed us to think outside the box, try to innovate, break preconceived notions, and move forward with confidence.
