# Natural Language Processing
I took this course under Prof. Kai Shu during Fall 22. This was one the most fun and innovaive courses I took. <br>
Hvaing no experience with Natural Language Process or anything related to, still this course felt like a breeze. I was awestruck with Prof. Shu teaching methods and calm demenor. 
His ability to make the most complex concepts easy to understand such that even babies could understand NLP and have the confidence to work with LLMs.
