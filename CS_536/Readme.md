# Science of Programming
I took this course under Prof. James Sasaki during Fall'22. This course was heavily focused on Discrete Mathematics. To this day, I have no clue what I leanred, how I passed the exams, never saw the face of my teammate with whom I collaborated remotely on 10 assignmnets and the best part was we were never sure if our answers were correct or wrong. This was one of the most funny subjects as I was so lost during this, it's not that professor teaching was bad, this course quickly beat me. I understood my limits to understand Discrete Maths and I faied. I'm still scared to open the notes to look back at it, all I know after the finals the professor caught 11 studnets personally for copying/sharing answers. I was even struglling to figure out if any of my solutions were correct and just hoping to pass this class. Kudos to those who scored an A in this course as well as to the courage and confidnce of those who shared their answers during finals.
This course just beat me to the curb...
## Course Description
Formal specification of how programs execute operational semantics , how mathematical functions programs compute denotational semantics , and how to use logic to characterize properties and invariants of the program execution (axiomatic semantics).
