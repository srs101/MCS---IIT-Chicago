# Science of Programming
I took this course under Prof. James Sasaki in Fall '22. The course was heavily focused on Discrete Mathematics. To this day, I have no clue what I learned or how I passed the exams. I never even saw the face of my teammate with whom I collaborated remotely on 10 assignments, and the best part was, we were never sure if our answers were correct or wrong. <br><br>This was one of the funniest subjects for me because I was completely lost throughout. It wasn’t that the professor's teaching was bad—this course simply beat me. I came to understand my limits when it comes to Discrete Math, and I failed. To this day, I'm still scared to open my notes and look back at it.<br>after all I know, professor caught 11 students personally for copying/sharing answers during finals. I was even struglling to figure out if any of my solutions were correct and just hoping to pass this class. <br><br>Kudos to those who scored an A in this course as well as to the courage and confidance of those who shared their answers during finals.<br><br>
This course just beat me to the curb...
## Course Description
Formal specification of how programs execute operational semantics , how mathematical functions programs compute denotational semantics , and how to use logic to characterize properties and invariants of the program execution (axiomatic semantics).
